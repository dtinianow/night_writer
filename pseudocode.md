Account for 80 character line limit:
If the array of characters is greater than 80 characters, break the array into smaller arrays
Use scan method?


<!-- If the letter is capitalized && the key is hash[array[0]] or hash[array[1]], add ".." and the corresponding characters
Elsif the letter is capitalized && the key is hash[array[2]], add ".0" and the corresponding characters
Else: -->

Iterate through each character in first array
Print two symbols corresponding with each character
Continue until all characters are printed

Go to next line and repeat until there are three lines of braille printed
Repeat process with any remaining arrays

Save line1 as a string
If line1 is greater than 80 characters, cut off the end and save it as a string
If the string is greater than 80 characters, break it into an array of strings
["Hello world"]=
